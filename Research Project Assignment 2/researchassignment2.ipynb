This is indicated by the NATENVIR variable; I am also potentially interested in a similar variable called NATEDUC, but will likely focus on NATENVIR for this specific assignment. I have not yet settled on my own data set, so I attempted to find a relevant variable in the GSS data repository. The NATENVIR variable interests me because it relates loosely to my primary interest in climate issues and public education/awareness. \n",

I have included other variables of interest such as race, but will not use them in my bivariate tabling for the sake of time. My expectation is that as respondents increase in educational attainment, they will value protection of the environment more highly on average. \n",

I think that there may be an intervening relationship where, because environmental issues have gained traction in recent decades, people at the same educational level may have a bit more concern over the environment over time.

Overall, support for environmental protection is a little higher than expected for all educational completion categories - but the change across increasing levels of educational completion is not as dramatic as I expected. These results seem to support my hypothesis, but not compellingly. Controlling for decade does not seem to have a significant effect, but it might be arguable that there is a mild interaction effect which is causing less than high school respondents to trend downward over time. The other categories either fluctuate very slightly or stabilize, so I am unsure whether there is enough information to determine a relationship with the control variable there.
